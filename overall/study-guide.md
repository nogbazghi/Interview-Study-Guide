Data Structure | Specifics
--- | ---
Singly Linked List  | [placeholder]
Doubly Linked List| [placeholder]
Circular Linked List  |
Queue| [placeholder] |
Stack| [placeholder] |
Deque| [placeholder] |
Hash Table| Synchronized, allows duplcates, doesn't allow nulls, (K,V)  |
Hash Map | No duplicates, not synchronized, order is not maintained, not thread safe, allows null
Hash Set |
Set | Interface
 Map |   Interface
 Binary Tree| each node has two leaves
 Binary Search Tree|    Left = less, Right = greaters
 Priority Queue|





Sorting  Algorith | WC | BC | Avg (if applicable)| When to use?
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Quick Sort | O(N^2) | O(log(N)) | O(N*log(N))| Stable runtime isn't required. You may randomize your pivot selection in order to get more stability.
Merge Sort|O(n*log(n))| O(n*log(n))|X| You require a consistent runtime
Heap Sort| | | X|
Intro Sort| | | X|
Tim Sort| | | X|
Selection Sort| | | X|

Radix Sort| | | X|
Bucket Sort| | | X|
