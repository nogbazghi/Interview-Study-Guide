Hash Table| [placeholder] | [placeholder] | Synchronized, allows duplcates, doesn't allow nulls, (K,V)  |
 Hash Map |    |    | No duplicates, not synchronized, order is not maintained, not thread safe, allows null |

Sorting  Algorith | WC | BC | Avg (if applicable)| When to use?
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Quick Sort | O(N^2) | O(log(N)) | O(N*log(N))| Stable runtime isn't required. You may randomize your pivot selection in order to get more stability.
Merge Sort|O(n*log(n))| O(n*log(n))|X| You require a consistent runtime
Heap Sort| | | X|
Intro Sort| | | X|
Tim Sort| | | X|
