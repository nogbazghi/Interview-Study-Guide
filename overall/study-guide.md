#Study Guide Topics

These will be discussed:

1. Data Structures
  * Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Queue
  * Stack
  * Deque
  * Hash Table
      
    [Synchronized, allows duplcates, doesn't allow nulls, (K,V)]
  * Hash Map
    
    [No duplicates, not synchronized, order is not maintained, not thread safe, allows null]
  * Hash Set
    
    [No duplicates, not synchronized, allows null]
  * Set, Map (Interface)
  * Binary Tree [each node has two leaves]
  * Binary Search Tree [Left = less, Right = greater]
  * Priority Queue
  *

Sorting  Algorith | WC | BC | Avg (if applicable)| When to use?
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Quick Sort | O(N^2) | O(log(N)) | O(N*log(N))| Stable runtime isn't required. You may randomize your pivot selection in order to get more stability.
Merge Sort|O(n*log(n))| O(n*log(n))|X| You require a consistent runtime
Heap Sort| | | X|
Intro Sort| | | X|
Tim Sort| | | X|
Selection Sort| | | X|
